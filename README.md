# Absenteeismatwork.github.io

Completed this project in Microsoft SQL Server and created dashboards in PowerBI

Joined tables of absenteeism at work, reasons, and compensation to analyze data 

Analyzed data to find the healthiest people (nonsmokers), compensation rate increase for non smokers and optimized the query to include a reason for absence based on the season with a case statement. 

Additionally analyzed reasons for absence based on body mass index categories and month with a case statement.
