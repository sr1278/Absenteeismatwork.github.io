Project Overview: 
The dataset used is the “Absenteeism at work” dataset. This dataset was created with records of absenteeism at work from July 2007 to July 2010 at a courier company in Brazil. it has also been used in academic research at the Universidade Nove de Julho — Postgraduate Program in Informatics and Knowledge Management. I completed this project in Microsoft SQL Server and created dashboards in PowerBI. 

Data Analysis and Procedure: 
I joined tables of absenteeism at work, reasons, and compensation to analyze data. Through analysis, I found the healthiest people (nonsmokers), compensation rate increase for nonsmokers and optimized the query to include a reason for absence based on the type of season (spring, summer, fall, winter) with a case statement.  Additionally analyzed reasons for absence based on body mass index categories and month with a case statement. 

Utilized a case statement to sort and analyze through body mass index into different BMI categories.
